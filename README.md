**Pie Chart: Currency Pair Liquidity Percentages**

The pie chart displays the distribution of liquidity associated with different currency pairs. Each segment of the chart represents the percentage of liquidity corresponding to a specific currency pair. The numeric values on each segment indicate the exact liquidity percentage for each currency pair.

Liquidity is a critical factor in trading as it signifies the ability to quickly convert an asset (currency pair) into cash without causing significant price changes. Currency pairs with higher liquidity typically have higher trading volumes, making them more attractive to traders due to their ease of buying and selling.

This chart provides a clear visualization of how liquidity is distributed among specific currency pairs, which can help traders make informed decisions when designing trading strategies and building well-diversified portfolios.
